My kitchen was not yet set up hence we(me and my male friend) went out for dinner to a restaurant which was located at a very central area. At about 10:30PM, we were done with our dinner and while heading towards my car which was parked about 500 meters from the restaurant, four men(looked like in their forties) started calling me out, saying 'excuse me', on turning towards them, they started teasing me, passing comments like 'miss you', 'hello' and all. My friend got furious with them but I somehow managed to convince him to get into the car and  We chose not to react. However, my friend asked me to stay inside the car and went out to note down their car number. These men seemed to notice him note down their car number, and after a while, they started man handling him. Fortunately I had a 'Naga chilly spray' with me. I took that out, ran towards them and managed to knock out three of them with the same. The fourth man got hold of my hand and pushed me down the road, and I hit my head. The saddest part was that people around were watching as if there is a drama being played on the road. Nobody came for help. While my friend was busy at the other end trying to fight with the rest of them, I saw one of the men take out iron rods from their car dickey. I pulled my friend telling him no one is gonna come for help and we will not be able to help ourselves either. We ran towards the car and immediately went inside. On turning the car to take a U-turn, two or three of them came running towards us with the intention to hit us, but since we were already inside, they smashed all sides of my car glasses. We rushed to the nearest police station asking for help. On showing them their car number(which my friend luckily noted down), the police personnel hesitated to file an FIR(As per our understanding, they seemed to be local/political goons residing in the same area. We left my car at the police station for the night, returned home at about 3AM in the morning and again went back to the police station for filing the FIR.

Harassment is not necessarily an attack by just strangers, it can be an intense assault within the confinements of your house you considered your home. Here I am typing my own story of an account which shook my life and left it scarred in a way that I attest as irreversible. On an eventful Sunday, I returned home to an eerie silence. The tension in the air was palpable and the looks in the eyes of my dad were unmistakably of anger. I kept quiet and walked to my room, hoping that I was just worrying for no reason. I slouched on my bed with a slice of chocolate cake and tuned into my favorite channel on TV. Two hours later I was summoned by my Dad for a discussion and I knew at that very moment that all my fears will materialize in a span of few seconds. I come from a conservative family, where I am the only girl who is working in a corporate, who is career oriented, and independent in her thoughts and actions. Truly liberal and yet righteous in my thoughts, I have never questioned my approach towards life. I have been constantly put down by my family, I have incessantly been compared to my elder brother, my thoughts have been suppressed, and my ideals have been questioned. That night, my dad was furious for I was out on a Sunday with my friends for a social cause, in a mixed group of girls and guys, which was unacceptable to him; though God knows why he co-educated me; though God knows why despite being an educated man, his thoughts were shallow and hurtful as they demeaned women. He was in a rage that I was too independent for his governance and societal norms. He considered my independence and will to make a mark as insolence and immoral. He wanted me to be confined to the four walls of my house, preparing myself to get married without even realizing my dreams. As I sat there objecting, he asked for my phone and decided to cut me off from my social circle. He crushed my brand new phone to pieces and threw the broken pieces right at my face, the shattered screen leaving scratches wherever the tiny broken glasses pricked me. As I further relented, he hurled abuses and called me names a father can never associate with his own daughter. My tears had dried listening to it all, I was feeling stronger and motivated to not succumb to this harassment; this was the worst I had seen and somewhere it brought me to peace that I had already faced the worst. I constantly defended my education, my career, and my strong ideals against his baseless , autocratic, and barbaric thoughts. I would call it barbaric as I could have never imagined that my own father would move agitatedly around looking for a knife in the kitchen to further harm me. That just killed every emotion I could associate with a father-daughter relationship. I stood upto him and looked him in the eye and told him that this was the worst thing he could ever do and he shall never be forgiven. Our relationship ended that night and I haven’t spoken to him eversince. As I walked out of that room, and not that house, just for the sake of my mother, I wept endlessly in my room, not able to fathom what just happened to me and why. My dad’s extreme behavior, the silence of my mother, and the fear in my brother’s eyes made me realize how shallow our society is; how can we even call it a society where one’s life means nothing just because she is a girl. Who allows them to believe that women are weak or inferior?  There is absolutely no logic, no rationale, and absolutely no forgiveness for anyone who cannot respect a woman, be it our own parents. I know of so many girls who are living a far more dreadful existence and I have penned my story not for sympathy, not for appreciation for standing up for myself, but simply to encourage all the women and men reading this to propagate an understanding of how beautiful, divine, and amazing women are as god’s creation. I want us all to make a society where every woman is safe, happy, and successful; where every woman is an equal to every man. Do not cry, do not lose hopes, and do not deprive yourself of education as that is your true independence and absolute achievement. As we pin the creeps across the cities, and enlist all the crime spots around us, we need to realize that women are suffering at the hands of their own families. A true movement of women safety will begin when all the women stand up for themselves. Only when you respect yourself will the world respect you.

First, it is amazing how distinctions are being drawn by many between language used inside the parliament and outside. Let me begin with unreservedly condemning Defence minister, Khwaja Asif’s, comment on opposition leader Shireen Mazari’s voice; his rhetorical request to make her voice feminine and the use of the term ‘truck trolley’.\\r\\n\\r\\nMohammed Hanif’s insightful piece on the subject correctly identifies these remarks as harking to patriarchal expectations of how everything ‘woman’ should conform to a standard set by a male; how men in this society feel —— to dictate terms, behaviour, dress and even tenor of voice to a woman. From anyone else it would have been bad enough, but from a member of parliament and a cabinet minister, everyone expects a higher standard of restraint and control over his anger.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the seriousness with which this is being debated and protested in the parliament makes me a little perplexed. When the same parliamentarians indulge in, and see, much worse language and behaviour outside the parliament in public spaces, on national television and social media, how do they expect to have it not creep into the house? Aren’t they the same people, talking about each other outside and inside the house? Indeed, aren’t their supporters and we all a part of the same society? I was dismayed, but not too surprised by the altercation in the house between Ms Mazari and Khwaja Asif.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am more surprised at the indignation, given that the indignant people know very well how low the standards of any kind of discourse have plunged all around us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same PTI, that is up in arms right now (rightly), has never bothered to condemn or be indignant about the utterly obscene abuse hurled at their sisters and fellow citizens who oppose them politically. One is witness to such language, abuse and misogyny on social media and television day in and day out. PTI leaders’ language and abuse for their male opponents from atop containers and on television shows is no secret either, hence I do not feel the need to repeat it here.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther parties, too, have been guilty of similar behaviour, though not to the same cesspit extent. But they certainly are guilty of acting surprised when something like this happens on the floor of the house. They should have been condemning and boycotting those who have played an active part in dragging standards of discourse so low that one is afraid to even speak for fear of abuse.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the guilty parties is certainly the media. Everyone knows which channels or show hosts love to create situations that might give dividends in the shape of some abuse, salacious slurs, a few slaps, punches or glasses of water and coffee thrown about. Why then do those who claim to be above it all not boycott these channels and shows? Why does every MNA, MPA, advisor, activist, economist etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nstill behave like a media whore and grace shows of hosts they know encourage abuse, fights and bad language to obtain ‘ratings’? Why do they act all sanctimonious now?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is appalling that leading lights of several opposition parties continued to spend all their energies and time, and use up all of the media’s energy and time on the so called TORs for the Panama Leaks commission day in and day out. It seemed as if nothing else was happening in the country; as if everyday there was not a report of a woman being burnt alive for honour, or some other equally horrifying or serious issue that could merit their attention. But the self serving focus on going after the Prime Minister to the exclusion of all other duties was disgusting to say the least.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne’s ears oozed with pus at the non-stop months long hyena shrieking press conferences and appearances on TV shows on the Panama TORs. It was only when the fourth girl in four days was murdered that leader of the Senate, Raza Rabbani, took notice and tasked the senate to do something about it – after which everyone made it their ‘cause’. This is the level of apathy towards the plight of the people generally, and to the growing violence towards women.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs our rulers’ apathy, and the resultant impunity from violence against women, exactly not the reason that Senator Hamdullah (I can’t believe he is a senator) of the JUI thought he could, in the presence of several people in the studio, and on national television, level not only the most explicit, pornographic and filthy abuse at well known rights defender and columnist Marvi Sirmed, but also thought he could beat her up? What he did, and tried to do, in public should demonstrate to everyone the level of apathy towards violence against women in this country; it should demonstrate to everyone what is going on behind closed doors. If this man thought he could, and would, get away with what he was doing, it should tell all something about the state of this society.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo fearless is the JUI, and sure of support from the ruling party and the government of the day, that after the day before’s assault on Marvi Sirmed, Hafiz Uzaifa Shakir of JUI-F yesterday released a video saying, “hum Pashtun gali ka jawab goli se dete hein” (we Pashtun respond to abuse with bullets).\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is tragic and heartbreaking that not a single PML-N leader has publicly condemned the JUI senator for reasons of political expediency. It is brave women like Marvi Sirmed who stand to support elected governments; it is people like her who stand to protect the democratic project; but the ‘democrats’ we support and protect forsake us at these crunch times that are true tests of democratic norms and values.', 'This episode happened recently to  one of my friend who stays in this area.

Loving and getting high on the reaction he'd caused in me. This thought made me lighten up. I didn’t want to give him the satisfaction. I looked around cheerily again.

I mean at this stage in his addiction (I’m assuming that I am not blunderously attractive and he just says this kind of thing to young girls), he probably does it out of compulsion, but he must have started somewhere. I don’t know a single person who would say out loud something like this, even in a relationship, during a naughty role play night. This I believe is tougher than proposing to a girl. Or maybe it isn’t for him. Maybe he was brought up in a family in which an angry father told his daughter off with heavy abuses, the mother was openly told by the father that she is to pleasure him tonight, the siblings would call each other swear words involving their mother, the sister was casually called “prostitute” and told to do things wives are fit for.\\r\\nPS: Please note that the date n time are approximates.\", 'It happened to me when i was 9 years old. my cab driver used to drop me to my home at the very last and that time he used to take me to a construction site and try to kiss and hug me.', 'Auto driver coaxed to give the contact number.The girl refused,boarded the train and left.

All too often, working women have tales of their perversions: the lesser ones include gaze and glance, the occasional grope, the unwanted text message, the innuendo; the bigger ones include invitations to meet outside the office, over lunch or dinner — with plum assignments, promotions, job security and professional reputations hanging in the balance.\\r\\nResignation is no guarantee of reprieve; there are reference letters to be obtained, future employment to be worried about. In an expensive, inflation-wracked and increasingly competitive Pakistani workplace, there are many women who continue to be targets for men with power.\\r\\nThe arithmetic of want and need is in display; divorced women, single mothers, the older and the unmarried are particularly vulnerable to harassment. In the words of one single mother who endured 10 years of harassment, the pursuit is constant, and any attempt to escape is punished further with denials of promotions and humiliation before colleagues. Co-workers, often witnesses, say nothing, eager to avoid a situation that could result in retaliation, a loss of their own positions. Sexual harassment from superiors is hence often coupled with isolation by colleagues who watch, witness and withdraw. The harassed are not only the persecuted but also the pariah.\\r\\nThere is a law against all this in Pakistan. The Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010, which will be six years old, is a thorough document. The code of conduct included in it defines harassment as “any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favours or other verbal or written communication or physical conduct of a sexual nature, or sexually demeaning attitudes, causing interference with work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, or the attempt to punish the complainant for refusal to comply with such a request or is made a condition for employment”.\\r\\nIt goes on to add that “the above is unacceptable behaviour in the organisation and at the workplace, including in any interaction or situation that is linked to official work or official activity outside the office”.\\r\\nThe abuse of authority, creating a hostile work environment, and retaliation are the three categories that mandate action against a harasser. Detailed stipulations are set out for the establishment of investigative committees, ombudspersons, etc, who are charged with resolving the issues raised. A range of penalties from censure to outright dismissal are postulated. All employers are required to display the code of conduct prominently on their premises.\\r\\nWhen the law was passed in 2010, it was feted as a success. It would take time for its provisions to change the culture of the workplace, the more circumspect said. Change comes slowly but a law is a first step; a legislative commitment supported by elected representatives’ signals that the path ahead will be a different one, in this case one where the harassment of women in the workplace would not be permitted.\\r\\nNot much has happened since then. Harassment is still rampant in the workplace (the majority of workplaces have little idea as to what the code of conduct is, let alone of the requirement to display it visibly in employee areas).\\r\\nWomen still regularly report being verbally harassed and even physically assaulted by their superiors who, making calculations regarding their need for a job, their desire to get ahead, their inability to refuse, unabashedly continue with such acts. In the face of unwanted advances, Pakistan’s women continue to find themselves alone, unsure of where to take their complaints and how to protect themselves.\\r\\nEven in the development sector, where the very agenda of many organisations is to empower women, similar problems persist. In one, a co-founder of an organisation faced so much harassment by a male colleague that she was ultimately forced out. New, more pliant women hired to take her position have since complained of similar problems. The man in question, however, remains untouched, undoubtedly displaying similarly harassing behaviour to new prey. Other men have come to his defence — perhaps recognising their own behaviour in those of others and eager to ensure that no one gets punished.\\r\\nMisogyny is manufactured in two major flavours in Pakistan. The first is on the premises of religious obscurantists whose hankering for the reinstatement of a strictly segregated society sees the harassment-filled workplace as a grim substantiation of their warnings. Women should not be in the workplace at all, the male conscience is unable to police itself.\\r\\nThe second, one that wrongly labels itself as liberal and progressive, imagines it to mean a licence to harass and harangue. A woman’s willingness to put up and shut up is, in its mind, the product of this ‘progressivism’, its illogical mindset equating women in the public sphere with women sexually available to all men who may want them. The two flavours compete, their poisons infecting the working lives of women — doctors, lawyers, shopkeepers, bankers, teachers, professors and countless others — who are daily force-fed these bitter morsels of misogyny.\\r\\nLaws alone cannot change society; the sexual harassment of women (and nearly everyone who reads this article either knows someone or is someone who has faced harassment) continues because it is considered permissible, something women ‘ask’ for when they leave their homes.\\r\\nThis belief is reflected all the time and everywhere in Pakistan, in soap operas that vilify working women as predators out to seduce innocent men, to workplace conversations in which men dissect the desirability of their female colleagues, their participation often a measure of a masculinity that fears competition from women. In the matter of sexual harassment in Pakistan’s workplaces, there are the guilty and the very guilty, they are far too many men complicit, quiet, eager to embrace or enforce their right to harass.', 'Students of Karachi University are protesting against yet another sexual harassment case.

I was barely entering 11th grade. Now, as I leave high school with flashbacks of this day and all the times my body has been the empty canvas for boys to splatter paint on, I will tell you the story of a 10th grader in Gurgaon.\\r\\n\\r\\n&quot;The stranger’s lips grazed upon the ends of my cheek. My bruised arm was pinned down on the dusty grey ground of the room while I kept my alert eyes outside on the faces of unknown men in uniform. They smirked as the stranger slid his snake-like fingers down my body. He struggled to undo the button. I could feel my eyes turn red when I bit him hard into his shoulder and in a small voice said, “No, I have to leave. I don’t like this.” I felt the empty liquor bottle against my legs and his hands against my flesh. I jerked up and pushed him aside. My head buzzed of alcohol and panic as I managed to stand up and look around. Did I really want this? He straightened up and pressed my frail body upon the naked wall. No, I did not. I pushed him aside and ran towards the open hall. Men of all ages stood on the railings, oblivious of the act. My cheeks burned of forced kisses and shame. Holding my shoes in my hands, I scurried through the staircase in the search of a known face. Who was I looking for? Who was I running from? I reached the cold lobby of an office. I stared at the entrance, and there he was- my strange glaring at my anxious face. He shoved my stiff self on the closed elevator, seeking to unfasten my pair of shorts. He settled for forcing his slithering fingers down my waist. He whispered, “I am going to finger you like an asshole,” as I whimpered and hopped away from him. I felt the back of my clothes, seeking for a phone. It wasn’t there. A rush of panic and exhaustion, and I fled out of the office to the hallway. I rummaged around the building, exploring every step I took earlier, to search for a prized possession. It was not there. My eyes burned even more now. Tears blinded my vision and settled on my raw cheeks. He was behind me. I rushed downstairs and headed for the busy road. It was broad daylight, as I scuttled barefoot in the search of my friend. It was too late. She was gone, and my stranger was behind me, grabbing my shirt. His strong hands ripped the cloth. My bare back became exposed to the blinking lights and stare of million nameless men. I cried for help but nobody cared enough to hear. I ran faster, without the possession of a phone, money or my bag. Why was I here? I gazed at the crowd nearby. I came to rest on a staircase. Tears ran down my face, unknown figures settled around me but in my head, I knew what to do. “Him,” I whispered as I strived to punch the familiar number down on a phone.\\r\\nDo you remember the moment when you were child and you had gone astray from your parents in a crammed up market place? How at that moment, you were devoid of any thoughts and the only thought of worth was how to get back to your safe haven? Do you remember the worry on their faces? That moment was of such magnitude. I shook back and forth, glancing through abundant faces, unable to see his delicate features muddled up with concern. Men and women walked past me, putting forward a helping hand but I did not trust them. It was a matter of minutes, when his agonized face rushed past me. I stood up and ran towards his open arms. The world stood still as he held me. I took in the accustomed smell of his cologne and felt a homesick wave crash on the walls of my head. “I’m scared, he’s going to find me.” I said, and that was enough for him to know. He took out a grey shirt from his bag and walked me out of the eyesight of alien people. “Wear it,” he murmured and propped his hand on my shoulders to pull me close. He rescued my other friend from the clutches of my stranger and his friends and departed from the cursed location. The ride ended at my house. He held my face and in a low voice, inaudible to my friend in the next room, asked me for a favour. “Don’t do anything stupid,” he said anxiously, as if reading my mind. The state of my friend was beyond the category of wasted, and following his given duty, he picked her up from the marble floor and led her towards the society’s gates. He waved a brief goodbye and timidly walked away from me.\\r\\nSometimes, you don’t need words to explain how you feel. Sometimes, you just know. Like that, I just knew. There, enfolded in his scent from his shirt, I felt possible. I was petrified from the episode, but his face made it easier to breathe in. Sometimes, you don’t need to be dating or loving somebody for months to feel comfortable with. You don’t need to kiss him, or even have him around you all the time. Just his nervous presence lingering around you in that moment is enough to demonstrate and establish a brief connection. He was my safe haven, even if for those few minutes. I was sorry that it was over but all the more glad, he was there for me. When he said those words on the phone, they were a formality. But standing there in the park, watching him walk towards the gates, I could feel it happening. It may not have been an episode of such importance for him, but for me, it changed everything.\\r\\nI’m sorry that the dance ended, but there, in your arms, I swear the world stood impossibly still.&quot;\\r\\n\\r\\nI attempted suicide a few hours later, but I was saved.

I had had exactly half a bottle of beer (pls note that this does not even fall under the category of 'alcohol drinking') since I was driving. At a police checkpoint, I was confident but respectfully asked if they could have a lady officer checking my alcohol content on the breathalyser due to a prior shocking incident where the police pulled out my keys and made me blow into the breathalyser 4 times since they couldn't find alcohol on my breath. Of course, this time round I was smarter and more cautious and did not fall victim much prior to them repeating the horror...or so I thought! The inspector said that 'they will not touch me and feel me' so I should cooperate with them testing my breath. However, I found that disrespectful and did not lower the window. They then clamped my car and began to shoot a video. I waited for somebody I know to come and when that happened, used the breathalyser. Of course, the alcohol content was negative and they made me blow a second time. By this time, we argued to be let go and left the place.
